Hello! I'm Max, welcome to my personal homepageüëã! I'm a Master's student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), Hong Kong, China. I am deeply passionate about delving into the fascinating domains of the Metaverse, game development, virtual humans, and digital twins, among others.


I'm currently a Project Assistant at the [CAFI Research Group](https://www.cafilab.com/) within PolyU, focusing on  Virtual Try-on and Garment Panel Generation.  I'm part of a fantastic team that's supportive and innovative.ü§ù We're all about collaboration and creating cool stuff together! üòä

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
