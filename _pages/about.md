Hello! I'm Max, welcome to my personal homepage👋! I'm a Master's student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), Hong Kong, China. I am deeply delving into the fascinating domains of the Metaverse, game development, virtual humans, and digital twins, among others.

I'm currently a Project Assistant at the [CAFI Research Group](https://www.cafilab.com/) within PolyU, focusing on Virtual Try-on and Garment Panel Generation. I'm part of a fantastic team that's supportive and innovative.🤝 We're all about collaboration and creating cool stuff together! 😊

Before joining PolyU, I earned my BEng  in Electronic and Communication Engineering📡 from [Yanshan University (YSU)](https://english.ysu.edu.cn/),China, where I was distinguished as an outstanding graduate. 

Now delving into the Metaverse, game development, and computing for my master's, I'm blending my hardware background with software prowess, aspiring to integrate innovative solutions at the crossroads of interactive media and industrial applications. 🚀
